					<p id="main_information"> <b> Bram Stoker </b><br><br>
					Bram Stoker was an irish author, known best for writing the ageless tale of <i>Dracula</i> in 1897. <br>
					In reality, during his life, he was better known as an assistant to Henry Irving and the manager of<br>
					the Lyceum Theatre, one of Irving's holdings. While he is best known for <i>Dracula</i>, he wrote a number of other<br>
					works, including <i>The Snake's Pass</i>, <i>The Lady of the Shroud</i>, and <i>The Lair of the White Worm</i>.<br>
					There is much more to be known about the author, including his friendships with other<br>
					very well known authors, including Oscar Wilde, and his inspiration for his novels, if one is so interested.<br>
					<br>
					<i>"Listen to themâ€”the children of the night. What music they make!"</i>
