					<p id="main_information"> <i><b> Dracula </i></b><br><br>
					This tale by Bram Stoker is as well-known as they come: the legendary origin story<br>
					of the modern-day vampire. The story follows a cast of characters,<br>
					ranging from a simple worker in a housing firm to a doctor of a mental institute,<br>
					through their diary entries as they encounter the fearsome creature<br>
					and struggle against, forces of darkness they barely comprehend, fighting<br>
					for their lives, and for the lives of those around them, in a mix of<br>
					stunning suspense as night falls, or even as morning arrives,<br> to heart-clenching excitement as each
					make their move.<br><br> 
					The story stands the test of time magnificently, enough so that<br>
					this classic story has earned its place on the docket of books<br>
					that we here recommend ANY reader of horror encounters,<br>
					as it has not disappointed yet.
