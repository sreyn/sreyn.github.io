					<p id="main_information"> <b> H.P. Lovecraft </b><br><br>
					Howard Phillips Lovecraft, more well-known by the shorthand H.P. Lovecraft, <br>was an American writer of "weird fiction" and horror,<br>
					and eventually he would become known as the pioneer or Father of a new subculture within the<br>
					horror and fiction genre: cosmic horror. His type of horror didn't revolve around the horrors existing,<br>
					or coming from, Earth and her holds. Rather, his focus was on the stars, on the cosmos, and highlighted<br>
					an accute form of existentialist dread, focusing on a horror of uncertainty and loss at beings and threats<br>
					that we as humans couldn't possibly begin to understand. While meticulously detailed in his works,<br>
					the objects of horror were always changing, shifting, unable to pin down and yet ever-present.<br>
					While he died in 1937 as a little-known author, he is now reverred as a king of the cosmic horror.<br>
					<br>
					<i>"That is not dead which can eternal lie, And with strange aeons even death may die."</i>
