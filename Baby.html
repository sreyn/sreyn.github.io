					<p id="main_information"> <i><b> Rosemarie's Baby </i></b><br><br>
					This book by Ira Levin encapsulates the meaning of suspense in every word of the book.<br>
					Masterfully woven, the tale follows a husband and wife couple, focused on Rosemarie herself,<br>
					as they move into their first house together. However, they are warned against moving to this home<br>
					on account of witchery and other wicked things making it their domain,<br>
					and as she herself finds, more and more strange, disturbing, and painful events<br>
					keep happening around her, just as she becomes pregnant. Struggling in the uncertainty of<br>
					both motherhood and the trust in those around her, the audience is pressed with suspense and horror<br>
					as we witness the story of Rosemarie's baby.<br>
					A beautiful mix of cultist, witchcraft, suspense, and popular panic<br>
					built on the worries and concerns of his time, Levin crafts a masterpiece of horror<br>
					that redefines the meaning of suspense, and instills a different, subtle, sinister terror.
