					<p id="main_information"> <i><b> The Rats in the Walls </i></b><br><br>
					This story, by the now-famous H.P. Lovecraft, centers around the return to a
					<br> ancestral home, if you would. The village surrounding this home regards it,<br> and
					the family who was housed in it, with a strange hatred.<br>Rather than drive off the protagonist, it urges him forward<br>
					into a tenebrous, dark past, riddled with spiritual and cosmic horror<br>
					that threatens to break him as he goes deeper and deeper into the history<br>
					of his own familial home.<br>
					This story, while well-regarded, does suffer from some issues of the time.<br>
					Nevertheless, the merit of the author later redeems this,<br>
					and the story itself is an interesting, inquiring look at horror from history,<br>
					and horror from the stars.
